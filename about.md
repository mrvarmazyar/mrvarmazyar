My name is Mohammad. It's roughly pronounced as [Mo:h@mm@d] [v@rm@zya:r] in IPA ASCII transcription.
It is a Persian name, natively written as محمد ورمزیار. I was born and grew up in Iran.
Currently, I am a DevOps Architect/Engineer at an international company in Canada.
Previously I was a DevOps, Cloud Engineer and Team leader at Alibaba Travels Co, PersianGiG and many iranian based companies, making technical life easier with container orchestration and cloud system implementations in motherland.
My long-term goal since late last century has been to make fully automated infrastructures in big companies in the world,
though these days my focus is not limited to new technologies and concepts anymore.
