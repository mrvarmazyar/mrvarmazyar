## Summary

Experienced DevOps Engineer with over a decade of expertise in cloud infrastructure management, system administration, and automation. Proven track record of integrating Azure and AWS components, cultivating seamless information access, and orchestrating infrastructure performance across diverse server platforms. Effective communicator collaborating with senior engineers, project managers, executives, and developers.

Passionately committed to streamlining operations through automation, I uphold the motto: "Ideas in mind, backed by Google, pave the way for innovative solutions."

Fueled by a strong interest in Cloud solution architecture, I excel in automating infrastructures with AWS and Azure, leveraging Kubernetes and Terraform. Proficient in crafting scalable systems, as well as overseeing build and deployment automation using Azure DevOps, GitLab, and Jenkins CI/CD. Skilled in establishing critical frameworks for logging (EFK), monitoring and alerting (Prometheus and Grafana), backup/restore, and disaster recovery. Equally adept at implementing service meshes like Istio and Linkerd, as well as configuring Nginx and Haproxy with LUAjit. Extensive familiarity with distributed and object storage solutions such as Glusterfs, Ceph, and Minio, alongside a working knowledge of On-Premise cloud platforms like OpenStack and CloudStack.

A fervent advocate of Open Source platforms, I am keen to contribute to their growth. My deep-seated enthusiasm for constructing digital infrastructure stems from its transformative impact on project efficiency and speed-to-market.

Championing automation and subscribing to a technology-driven approach, I recognize tools as enablers within the broader framework of automation. My core focus centers on visualizing end goals and products throughout the automation process.
