Hey there! I’m Mohammad Varmazyar, and I’m thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the internet. If you’re here, you’re probably as obsessed with cloud infrastructure, automation, and observability as I am—or maybe you’re just curious about what makes a Platform Engineer tick. Either way, you’re in the right place!

A bit about me: I’ve spent the past decade diving deep into cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, wrangling infrastructure to be more efficient, scalable, and robust. Currently, I’m part of the Data Platform team at Delivery Hero, where we’re all about making data move faster and systems more resilient. Whether it’s setting up Kubernetes clusters, automating deployments with Terraform, or ensuring everything’s running smoothly with our observability stack (shoutout to Grafana, Datadog, and Prometheus), I’m all in.

Programming is another big part of my life. I’ve got solid experience with Go, Python, and good ol’ Bash scripting, which comes in handy when I’m building tools to make our infrastructure smarter or troubleshooting issues at the system level. I’ve worked with a wide variety of tech stacks over the years, from container orchestration systems like Kubernetes to more traditional setups, and I’m always up for learning something new.

One of the most exciting (and challenging) aspects of my job is the work we do as DevOps and SRE engineers. Whether it’s ensuring our systems are observable and our logs are actionable, or tackling complex problems in distributed systems, there’s never a dull moment. We’re constantly pushing the envelope, using tools like Grafana and Datadog to monitor performance and ensure everything is running like a well-oiled machine. And when things go sideways, well, that’s when the real fun begins—digging into metrics, tracing issues, and figuring out how to prevent them from happening again.

But enough about work—let’s talk about this website. I created it as a space to share the knowledge and experiences I’ve gathered over the years. From deep dives into specific tools and technologies to broader discussions on best practices in DevOps and SRE, I’m hoping this blog will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their own practices or just learn something new.

So, stick around! I’ve got a lot to share, and I’m excited to take you along on this journey through the world of platform engineering, cloud computing, and beyond.

Cheers,
Mohammad
