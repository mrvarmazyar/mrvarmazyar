Hey there! I’m Mohammad Varmazyar, a Platform Engineer with a passion for Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and automation. Over the past decade, I’ve immersed myself in the world of cloud infrastructure, working with some of the leading technologies in the industry, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Whether it's setting up Kubernetes clusters, automating deployments with Terraform, or ensuring observability through tools like Grafana, Datadog, and Prometheus, I'm all about making complex infrastructures run smoothly.

Beyond my work, I’m a strong advocate of open-source technologies and enjoy contributing to the community. I have a solid background in programming with Go, Python, and Bash scripting, which I leverage to develop tools and automate processes that enhance the efficiency and reliability of cloud systems.

This website is my space to share the knowledge and experiences I’ve gathered throughout my career. Whether you’re here to learn about best practices in DevOps, explore the intricacies of cloud platforms, or just curious about the life of a Platform Engineer, you’ll find plenty of insights and stories here.
