        <p>The role of a DevOps Engineer is one of the most sought-after positions in IT today, and it often comes with a lucrative salary. However, the path to landing this role can vary greatly depending on the company, with job titles like Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) or Platform Engineer sometimes being used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in titles and interview processes, the core responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer remain consistent. We’re the ones bridging the gap between development and operations teams, driving automation and continuous delivery practices, and ensuring the reliability and scalability of applications and infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you’re aiming to pursue a career as a DevOps Engineer or in a similar role, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand that every organization has its specific requirements and responsibilities. Doing your homework on what each company expects will not only prepare you for the interview process but also help you position yourself as a strong candidate.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m sharing the blueprint that has helped me succeed in DevOps interviews throughout my career. By following these tips and strategies, you can significantly improve your chances of landing that coveted role.</p>

  What Level of Coding Skills is Necessary?

<p>DevOps Engineers come from various technical backgrounds—some from operations, others from software engineering. This diversity means that anyone with the right mindset and a willingness to learn can become a DevOps Engineer.</p>
<p>For those of you with an operations background, coding might seem daunting at first, especially when faced with coding interviews. But coding is a skill that can be learned and honed over time. Dedicate a few hours each day to practicing coding, and you&rsquo;ll see improvement.</p>
<p>Start by learning a programming language, and I recommend Python as your first choice. Python is easy to pick up and is widely used in DevOps for scripting and automation tasks. Focus on mastering the basics of programming, then move on to understanding basic data structures and algorithms. Advanced data structures can wait; your immediate goal should be to get comfortable enough to clear DevOps Engineer coding interviews.</p>
<p>In my experience, coding interviews for DevOps roles are generally less intense than those for software engineering positions. Often, companies will focus more on scenario-based technical questions related to the technology stack you’re familiar with, rather than on complex coding challenges.</p>
<h3 id="my-strategy-for-improving-coding-interview-skills">
  My Strategy for Improving Coding Interview Skills
  <a class="heading-link" href="#my-strategy-for-improving-coding-interview-skills">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Here’s the approach I used to sharpen my coding interview skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with easy-level questions.</li>
<li>Filter questions based on data structure types, beginning with Arrays and Strings.</li>
<li>Focus on understanding one data structure at a time and practice related questions. Don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to learn everything at once—this applies to algorithms as well.</li>
<li>Aim to complete at least 500 easy-level questions.</li>
<li>LeetCode is sufficient; there’s no need to invest in expensive courses.</li>
<li>Consistency is key. Don’t spend more than 30 minutes on a question. If you’re stuck, review the solution and try to write the code yourself. Writing code on paper and mentally executing it can be particularly helpful.</li>
</ul>

  Which Programming Language Should You Start With?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#which-programming-language-should-you-start-with">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Many beginners waste time debating which programming language to learn first. My advice: start with Python. It’s user-friendly and perfect for improving your problem-solving and logical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Don’t get bogged down by spending hours solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode. Instead, apply your Python knowledge to write simple automation scripts. For instance, automate tasks like listing files in an S3 bucket—this is much closer to what you’ll be doing as a DevOps Engineer.</p>
<p>Once you’re comfortable with Python, I suggest learning Golang. It’s more efficient and is increasingly popular in the DevOps community, making it a great way to set yourself apart.</p>

<p>To thrive as a DevOps Engineer, you should focus on mastering the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Terraform</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>ArgoCD</li>
<li>AWS / Azure / GCP</li>
<li>Ansible / Puppet / Chef</li>
</ul>

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is the leading technology for container orchestration, and it’s a highly desirable skill in the job market. While Kubernetes has a steep learning curve, don’t feel pressured to learn everything immediately. Companies don’t expect you to know every detail—just have a solid foundational understanding.</p>
<p>For learning resources, I personally recommend starting with the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes official documentation</a> and checking out books like &ldquo;Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes&rdquo; by John Arundel and Justin Domingus, and &ldquo;Kubernetes Patterns&rdquo; by Bilgin Ibryam and Roland Huß.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-containers-is-crucial">
  Understanding Containers is Crucial

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Containers are central to many modern projects, and understanding how they work internally will greatly benefit your career. Concepts like isolation and resource allocation, which are managed by Linux Cgroups and namespaces, are fundamental to container technology.</p>
<p>While there are many container runtime engines, you don’t need to master them all. Focus on understanding Docker and containerd—they’re widely used and will cover most scenarios you’ll encounter.</p>
<h3 id="automating-deployments-with-cicd-pipelines">

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>One of your core responsibilities as a DevOps Engineer will be to streamline the software delivery process through CI/CD pipelines. Gaining hands-on experience with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and ArgoCD is critical. You don’t need to learn every CI/CD tool out there; just focus on a few and get comfortable with them.</p>
<h3 id="accepting-that-you-cant-know-everything">
  Accepting that You Can’t Know Everything
  <a class="heading-link" href="#accepting-that-you-cant-know-everything">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>It’s important to recognize that you won’t be an expert in every technology or tool in the DevOps ecosystem. Instead, build a strong foundation in core areas while showcasing your ability to learn and adapt quickly. During interviews, be honest about what you know and demonstrate your eagerness to learn.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-a-positive-attitude">

<p>In DevOps, collaboration and communication are key. A positive attitude, willingness to work with others, and openness to feedback will set you apart from other candidates. Highlight your ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams and adapt to new technologies and methodologies.</p>

<p>To succeed in DevOps interviews, focus on mastering key technologies like Kubernetes and Docker, building practical experience with CI/CD pipelines, and strengthening your coding problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Remember, you don’t need to know everything, but having a positive attitude and a willingness to learn can make a significant difference. By following these strategies, you’ll be well-prepared for your next DevOps Engineer interview and increase your chances of landing your dream job in this rapidly growing field.</p>
