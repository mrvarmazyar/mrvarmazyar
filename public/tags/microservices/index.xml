      <description>In the world of modern cloud-native applications, orchestrating microservices efficiently is crucial for ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, providing a robust platform for deploying and managing microservices. However, as the number of microservices grows, managing and monitoring them can become complex.&#xA;This is where Istio comes in. Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a set of powerful tools for managing microservices traffic, enforcing security policies, and collecting telemetry data.</description>
