      <description>In recent years, the tech industry has witnessed a significant shift towards containerized application deployment, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and the adoption of Kubernetes for orchestration. Within this context, Kubernetes Operators have emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying and automating the management of complex applications on Kubernetes clusters. When combined with Docker, these technologies can optimize the development and deployment processes, leading to more efficient workflows and faster time-to-market for software products.</description>

      <description>In the world of modern cloud-native applications, orchestrating microservices efficiently is crucial for ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, providing a robust platform for deploying and managing microservices. However, as the number of microservices grows, managing and monitoring them can become complex.&#xA;This is where Istio comes in. Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a set of powerful tools for managing microservices traffic, enforcing security policies, and collecting telemetry data.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Running hundreds of daily tasks on Apache Airflow is a routine for data-driven companies like StoreMaven. We use Google’s managed Composer environment to streamline our data pipelines. However, as the number of tasks grows, the default Composer setup on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) reveals its limitations, particularly when it comes to scaling efficiently and cost-effectively.&#xA;In this post, I’ll share our journey of optimizing the Airflow Scheduler on GKE, which led to significant cost savings while maintaining high performance.</description>
